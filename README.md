# Features
- **User Authentication**: Secure registration and login system with username, email, and password. Users can update their profile details, including username, nickname, email, password, and avatar.
- **Real-Time Chat**: Supports real-time messaging using Socket.io, where messages load from the most recent at the bottom. The chat area displays avatars and usernames side by side.
- **Friendship Management**: Allows users to send, accept, or decline friend requests dynamically via AJAX. Friends are added to a sidebar that accommodates a large number of friends without overlapping other elements.
- **Voice Chat Feature**: Users can join voice chat rooms based on specific chat rooms. Each room can have up to 2 users, and direct calls are initiated without requiring the peer ID.
- **User Online Status**: Displays online or offline status based on the user's socket connection. The user schema includes an Online field that is updated when the user connects or disconnects.
- **Account Management**: Users can manage their account details such as username, nickname, email, avatar, and password. A modal interface is provided for updating these details asynchronously.
- **User Avatar Upload**: Users can upload and update their avatar images securely. The backend stores the path to the user's photo and ensures that old avatars are deleted to save storage.
- **Audio Settings**: Users can save and load audio configurations (input and output volume settings) to customize their experience.
- **Data Encryption**: Unique encryption keys are generated and saved in environment variables to secure sensitive data like passwords.
- **Peer-to-Peer Communication**: Integrates PeerJS for peer-to-peer communication and supports audio calls with microphone mute/unmute functionality.

# Technologies Used
